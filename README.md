# yaml-basic

## **YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a serialization language (like `JSON` ans `XML`).

`YAML`, `JSON` and `XMl` are the important pillars to transfer data from one tech to another tech. 

If two technology are used in backend (like `NodeJS` and `MySQL`) then `YAML` is used to communicate these two servers.

Yaml is more simplier and easy serialization language and its like a **key-value** pair
